Digital photos and videos are part of our daily life. The number of photos taken and videos recorded per day has been increase for the past few years. Automatically describing an image had always been a problem while connecting Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. We aim to merge 2 models - Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks to automatically generate an image description. The model is trained and fine-tuned to maximize the accuracy of the captions and descriptions generated. Text to Speech is then performed on the descriptions generated by the model. The proposed model is quite accurate, however, there have been rare cases where the model generated irrelevant results. The model was trained on COCO Dataset and was validated on random images and the data provided by the enterprise.
